<h1>What are stocks?</h1>
</center>
</u>
	<p>You have probably heard a popular definition of what a stock is: 
	A stock is a share in the ownership of a company. Stock represents a claim on the 
	company's assets and earnings. As you acquire more stock, your ownership stake in the company becomes greater.</p>

<h1>What is a Market Index?</h1>
	</center>
	</u>
	<p>A market index is a weighted average of several stocks or other investment vehicles from a section of the stock market, 
	and it is calculated from the price of the selected stocks. Market indexes are intended to represent an entire stock market 
	and track the market's changes over time. Index values help investors track changes in market values over long periods of time.
	For example, the widely used Standard and Poor's 500 Index is computed by combining 500 large-cap U.S. stocks into one index value. 
	Investors can track changes in the index's value over time and use it as a benchmark for their own portfolio returns. Below is a Chart
	that shows the historic returns of the S&P500 </p>
